## About Beargle

Beargle is an organization that makes tools to help teachers improve security in their schools. We believe that every student deserves a safe and secure learning environment, and we're want to provide teachers with the resources they need to make that happen.

Our tools are examples for how common "unblocking" tools are made our discord server copies many discord servers dedicated to unblocking the internet and our entire system basically beyond this piont is and open source replica of many unblocking orginizations.

We believe that every school should be a safe and secure place for students to learn. We want to help teachers achieve that goal, and we're always looking for the newest exploits to improve resources.

## Our Tools

We offer a wide variety of tools that are similiar to many unblocking programs wich can hopefully be investigated and used to improve security in schools. Our most best working tool is Beargleos wich is a fully unblocked operating system.
